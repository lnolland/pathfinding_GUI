# GUI pathfinding project
This project is wrote in python using pygame to make a Graphic User Interface. This GUI give the possibility to the user to make his own map, where are the start, end and the walls. There is a "random map" button which will randomize the map if the user doesn't want to make his own. Once the user choosed the disposition of the map, he can run the algorithms and see the difference in time complexity it take for Djikstra and a A* to reach the end.

The first left click lets the user place the start (the orange square), the second left click lets the user place the end (cyan square). When the start and the end are placed, the left clicks always place walls. the right click permit the user to remove a tile already place, if the end or the start are removed they will be the next left clicks.
