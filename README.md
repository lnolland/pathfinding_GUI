# GUI pathfinding project
This project is wrote in python using pygame to make a Graphic User Interface. This GUI give the possibility to the user to make his own map, where are the start, end and the walls. There is a "random map" button which will randomize the map if the user doesn't want to make his own. Once the user choosed the disposition of the map, he can run the algorithms and see the difference in time complexity it take for Djikstra and a A* to reach the end.
